# Requirements

# Python3
If you don't already have Python3 installed, please visit this link for instructions: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Pandas Library
After you have Python3 installed, run the following command in your Terminal or Console to install the Pandas library:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pandas
```

# How to Run

## Setup Dataset
To setup the data set, run the `data_setup.py` Python file by executing the following command:

```python
python3 data_setup.py
```

This will read the file `rt_reviews.csv` and create a new file called `rt_reviews_plagiarized.csv`. Both files are in the `data` folder.
